This developer console system is similar to every console system.
It allows you to set up own commands, which can be called from the console.

This asset includes four example commands 
(show all commands, levelload, spawn and destroy) and a commented text file.

You can use it for example for debugging or for ingame cheats.




How to create your own command?

Please look at the script developer console.

!!!!
Press TAB to enable/disable the developer console.
!!!!
Asset Commands:

.commands		//shows all commands
.load_levelX		//for x 1or2 (1 = Scene1 | 2 = Scene2)
.spawn			//spawns the prefab 1times
.spawn_endless		//spawns endless prefabs | stop spawning by pressing anything into the console
.destroy_all		//destroys all spawned Objects









I hope you understand everything clearly.
